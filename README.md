## Tools:

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Bootstrap

## Overview

In this project I focused on the front-end development of a simple sign-up form, attempting to ensure a good user experience and to meet accessibility guidelines. This is a mock website form with no back-end, so please note that any information entered will not be taken. The design uses white space to organize parts of the form for a more pleasant user experience.

## What I Learned

- Creating forms in HTML and how to use many different validations
- Getting a basic understanding of how to style forms to accept user input
- Incorporating bootstrap into the front-end
